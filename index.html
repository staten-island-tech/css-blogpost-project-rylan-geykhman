        <p class="blogtext">One of my favorite people in the world is Yan Sharma! Yan has bullied me into
            creating this post to immortalize his name in one of my first works. Yan has a lot of good qualities that
            one can learn from him, which is why he's one of my favorite.</p>

        <p>This may get some controversy, but my mind is too feeble to take this class. I mean, this
            project is probably the limit of my tiny brain. Anyways, I'm stuck and so I'll have to use my three brain
            cells to the max.</p>

        <p>This post is dedicated to the one problem I had with positioning images in the center such
            that I struggled for about an hour on this one thing. I mean, I know I was told struggle is good, but
            nothing is good in excessive amounts. This stands as a monumental moment in the year in which is one of my
            first struggles, but definitely not the last.</p>
