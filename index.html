        <p class="blogtext">One of my favorite people in the world is Yan Sharma! Yan has bullied me into
            creating this post to immortalize his name in one of my first works. Yan has a lot of good qualities that
            one can learn from him, which is why he's one of my favorite.</p>

        <p class="blogtext">This may get some controversy, but my mind is too feeble to take this class. I mean, this
            project is probably the limit of my tiny brain.</p>
